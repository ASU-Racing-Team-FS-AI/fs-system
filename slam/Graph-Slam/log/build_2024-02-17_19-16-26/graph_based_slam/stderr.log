  By not providing "Findg2o.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "g2o", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "g2o" with any of
  the following names:

    g2oConfig.cmake
    g2o-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "g2o" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "g2o_DIR"
  to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "g2o" provides a
  separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
